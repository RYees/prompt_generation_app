## Overview
By uploading relevant documents and files, the application can generate a comprehensive knowledge base of potential prompts, which are then stored in a vector database.

When a user interacts with the application, they can provide specific inputs or scenarios, and the system will respond by generating a prompt that is uniquely suited to their requirements. The application's RAG-powered engine analyzes the user's input and matches it against the stored prompts, drawing on the contextual information within the knowledge base to produce the most relevant and compelling prompt.

This seamless integration of user input, document-based prompt generation, and RAG-driven retrieval and generation sets the Prompt Generation Application apart. Users can now unlock their creativity and enhance their productivity by accessing a wealth of tailored prompts at their fingertips, without the need for extensive research or manual curation.

## Usage
This user-friendly application harnesses the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to provide you with personalized prompts tailored to your specific needs.

Getting Started:

* Upload your relevant documents, articles, or any other files that contain information relevant to your area of interest or work.
* The application will process these documents and create a comprehensive knowledge base of potential prompts, storing them in a vector database for easy retrieval.
* Generate scenarios using LLM which you edit to your desired scenario, topic, or any specific requirements you have in the designated text field.
* Based on the scenarios prompts will be generated. Now you can compare it with the rag knowledge base which contains prompts based on the uploaded document.
* The application's RAG-powered engine will analyze your input and match it against the stored prompts in the knowledge base.
* Based on the contextual information and the similarity between your input and the prompts, the application will generate a tailored prompt that is most relevant to your needs.
* Review the generated prompt and assess its relevance to your requirements.
